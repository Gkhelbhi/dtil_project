# dtil_project: Case Study: Community-Based Ride-Sharing Platform for Smarter, Greener Travel
**1. Introduction**
With increasing urbanization and vehicle ownership, cities are facing major challenges such as traffic congestion, rising fuel consumption, and air pollution. These issues not only affect individual commuters but also contribute significantly to global carbon emissions. Our project aims to address these challenges through a web-based platform where individuals can share their travel plans and offer rides to others heading in the same direction. This encourages shared mobility, reduces the number of vehicles on the road, and promotes a more sustainable and cost-effective way of traveling.

**2. Current State of Art**
Currently, a few global apps offer ride-sharing features (like BlaBlaCar or UberPool), but they are either limited by region, cost, or restricted to certain types of travel. Many of these solutions focus on urban centers and don't effectively support rural or semi-urban users. Additionally, they often require full commercial operations, leaving out individuals who casually want to share a ride. Our platform bridges this gap by offering a community-based, flexible approach where anyone can post or join a ride using any vehicle—be it a car, bike, or small bus—without needing a formal booking structure.

**3. Problem Statements**
Increasing number of private vehicles has led to excessive fuel usage, congestion, and pollution.
A lack of accessible, easy-to-use platforms for casual, short- and long-distance ride sharing.
Existing platforms often do not support non-commercial ride postings or flexible arrangements.
Difficulty in building trust and commitment between users in shared travel setups.
A general lack of awareness or motivation to adopt eco-friendly commuting habits.

**4. Solutions by All the Members of Group**
Each team member contributed uniquely to solving these challenges:

Member 1 focused on the platform's design, ensuring a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to post or find rides with minimal effort.
Member 2 worked on integrating features that promote trust and accountability, such as user verification, rating systems, and secure messaging.
Member 3 developed the environmental impact tracker, which shows users how much fuel and CO₂ emissions they save per shared trip.
Member 4 researched user behavior and added incentives such as badges or points for frequent users, encouraging long-term engagement.
Together, we designed a lightweight, accessible, and impactful web-based solution that balances convenience, cost-sharing, and sustainability.

**5. Describe the Web Page You Have Designed**
Our web page is built to be responsive and intuitive. On the homepage, users can:

View ongoing or upcoming shared rides posted by others.
Post their own travel plans, including source, destination, time, number of seats, and cost contribution.
Register or log in to access features like booking, messaging, and viewing profiles.
Track environmental impact metrics like estimated fuel saved and emissions reduced.

The site’s color scheme is eco-themed, using greens and blues to reflect its sustainable mission. Buttons are easy to find, and layout sections like "Your Rides", "Post a Ride", and "Explore Rides" are clearly separated.
